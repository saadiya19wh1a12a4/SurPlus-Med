# SurPlus-Med
Project made to donate and retrieve medicines. 
The cost of medicines has become a key concern  for the people living below the poverty line. To make at least a slight difference, we aimed to develop a web application which collects unused medicines from donors through the website and helps the people who are in need. SURPLUS MED  is a medicine donation system that can be used for donating and availing the medicines.
